!#**************************************************************************************
!#***  IOS Switch Hardening Script
!#***  Version: v1.0.0
!#**************************************************************************************
!#***  Device  Use on any non-outer Navy Unclassified Cisco Switch running IOS and SSH
!#**************************************************************************************
!#***  Purpose Use this script to harden the configuration prior to NOC turnover
!#**************************************************************************************
!#  NOTE  The command crypto key generate rsa general-keys modulus 2048 near the
!#         bottom of the script should be left commented out if a valid RSA key already
!#         exists on the device.  Look at the output of 'show crypto key mypubkey rsa'
!#         command from as-built test script.  A correct key will have a full page
!#         of characters.  It should have the correct device name and IP domain
!#         name on the key name line, like this example
!#         Key name SITE-U00-IR-01.NMCI-ISF.com
!#         If the key looks valid, don't re-apply the command.  Doing so creates
!#         a new RSA key, and causes attaching SSH clients to complain about it.
!#         If the as-built command output looks like this
!#             SITE-U00-IR-01#show crypto key mypubkey rsa
!#                                   ^
!#             % Invalid input detected at '^' marker.
!#         leave the generate command in.  This means the old IOS didn't support
!#         SSH, so this will be a key you're generating for the first time.
!#
!#  NOTE  The correct RSA key generation command for 2950 switches is
!#         crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024.  Uncomment that one rather than the
!#         'general-keys' variant below for use on a 2950 switch.
!#
!#  NOTE  For older switches that do not support 2048 bits, use 1024 bits.
